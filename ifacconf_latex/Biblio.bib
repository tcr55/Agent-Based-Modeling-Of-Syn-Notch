After the basic principles of agent-based simulation are briefly introduced, its four areas of application are discussed by using real-world applications: flow simulation, organizational simulation, market simulation, and diffusion simulation. For each category, one or several business applications are described and analyzed.},

Multi-agent approaches are often based on coordinating agents whose actions and interactions are related to the emergence of the phenomenon to be simulated. In this article, we focus on road traffic simulation, specifically the design of a road traffic simulation tool able to deal realistically with road junctions. We propose a multi-agent behavioral model based on (i) the opportunistic individual behaviors that describe the norm violation and (ii) the anticipatory individual abilities of simulated drivers that allow critical situations to be detected. Our proposition has been validated for different traffic scenarios. Specifically, we simulated the traffic in a real intersection and then compared the simulated traffic flow with the real flow to highlight the relevance of our approach.},

Notch is a transmembrane receptor that mediates local cell-cell communication and coordinates a signaling cascade present in all animal species studied to date. Notch signaling is used widely to determine cell fates and to regulate pattern formation; its dysfunction results in a tremendous variety of developmental defects and adult pathologies. This primer describes the mechanism of Notch signal transduction and how it is used to control the formation of biological patterns.},

Delta and Notch function are required for cell fate specification in numerous tissues during embryonic and postembryonic Drosophila development. Delta is expressed by all members of interacting cell populations within which fates are being specified and is subsequently down-regulated as cells stably adopt particular fates. Multiphasic expression in the derivatives of many germ layers implies successive requirements for Delta function in a number of tissues. At the cellular level, Delta and Notch expression are generally coincident within developing tissues. At the subcellular level, Delta and Notch are localized in apparent endocytic vesicles during down-regulation from the surfaces of interacting cells, implying an interaction consistent with their proposed roles as signal and receptor in cellular interactions during development.},

Studies on the expression, mutant phenotypes, and developmental consequences of unregulated receptor activation have implicated these proteins in a general mechanism of local cell signaling, which includes interactions between equivalent cells and between different cell types. Genetic approaches in flies and worms have identified putative components of the signaling cascade, including a conserved family of extracellular ligands and two cellular factors that may associate with the Notch Intracellular domain. One factor, the Drosophila Suppressor of Hairless protein, is a {DNA}-binding protein, which suggests that Notch signaling may involve relatively direct signal transmission from the cell surface to the nucleus. Several vertebrate Notch receptors have also been discovered recently and play important roles in normal development and tumorigenesis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Engineering multilayered cellular structures
The ability to program the manufacture of biological structures may yield new biomaterials or synthetic tissues and organs. Toda et al. engineered mammalian “sender” and “receiver” cells with synthetic cell surface ligands and receptors that controlled gene regulatory circuits based on Notch signaling. Programming the cells to express cell adhesion molecules and other regulatory molecules enabled spontaneous formation of multilayered structures, like those that form during embryonic development. The three-layered structures even showed regeneration after injury.
Science, this issue p. 156
A common theme in the self-organization of multicellular tissues is the use of cell-cell signaling networks to induce morphological changes. We used the modular {synNotch} juxtacrine signaling platform to engineer artificial genetic programs in which specific cell-cell contacts induced changes in cadherin cell adhesion. Despite their simplicity, these minimal intercellular programs were sufficient to yield assemblies with hallmarks of natural developmental systems: robust self-organization into multidomain structures, well-choreographed sequential assembly, cell type divergence, symmetry breaking, and the capacity for regeneration upon injury. The ability of these networks to drive complex structure formation illustrates the power of interlinking cell signaling with cell sorting: Signal-induced spatial reorganization alters the local signals received by each cell, resulting in iterative cycles of cell fate branching. These results provide insights into the evolution of multicellularity and demonstrate the potential to engineer customized self-organizing tissues or materials.
