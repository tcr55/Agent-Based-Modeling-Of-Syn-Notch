# Agent-Based-Modeling-Of-Syn-Notch
Five models for egent based modeling of Syn-Notch and Delta-Notch signaling in cells are provided.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Files Included
* Included are five modeling files and a folder containing Figures both supplemental and figures that were used in the paper.
* the included files are 
  * Final Single Genotype A signals B.nlogo
  * Final version Single Genotype Two Layer (contact inhibition).nlogo
  * Final version one genotype one notch.nolog
  * Final version Single Genotype Three layer.nlogo
  * final version Two Genotype Three Layer.nlogo
  * Supplemental images for paper (folder)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Prior to use requirements

NetLogo must be installed from https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/. The version used in these files is **Version 6.0.4**. 
* Note versions later than Version 6.0.4, specifically any version 5 or earlier, will **NOT** work with the current models, change in some commands render old versions of Netlogo incompatible with this version. 
* The converter which moves old files from version 5 to 6 would sometimes not work correctly, specifically in trying to use Reynolds etc al (2019) code which was written in version 5.
